# Cmeans
Fuzzy clustering is a form of clustering in which each data point can belong to more than one cluster.
This is the implementation of the fuzzy c-means algorithm an extension to the k-means algorithm for clustering.
The algorithm exploits fuzzy values and rules by which each point/data is considered to be in each cluster to some extent and is given a membership value. In each iteration, the leaders of each cluster and the membership values are calculated.
